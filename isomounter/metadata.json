  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nDownload and install Magic Disc from their site to mount iso files to your windows machine.  Magic Disc is freeware.  Their binary \"miso.exe\" is downloaded as well to enable commandline functionality.\n\nhttp://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-history.htm\n\nhttp://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/tip/How-to-install-and-manage-virtual-CD-DVDs\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nLooks like the driver signing requirements with Windows 2008 have broken magicISO (they do not sign their driver).  This is unfortunate; however, I have disabled the driver signing checks to hack around this.  I do not really like this solution; however, I do enjoy mounting DVD ISOs.\n\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nMost of the attributes simply refer to the version of Magic Disc.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nCommand line usage:\n\nmiso.exe NULL -sdrv 0\nDisable all virtual Drives.\n\nmiso.exe NULL -vlist\nList all of the present virtual CD/DVD driver\n\nmiso.exe NULL -mnt f: e:\\en_sql_server_2008_r2_standard_x86_x64_ia64_dvd_521546.iso\nMount the MSSQL iso located inside the root of the e:\\ drive to virtual drive f:\n\nmiso NULL -umnt f:\nUnmount virtual drive f:\n",
