  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nIt is a straightforward exercise to manage windows registry changes by either exporting or just writing out the registry changes to templates and then using a batch file wrapper around regedit to inject them into the registry.  Updates to the registry files will cause them to be reinjected.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThis cookbook does not have any other dependencies than regedit.  It should work on all versions of windows, without exception.\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\nMinimal.  I deploy a small number of registry changes across the board, and they are stored in an attribute array on the nodes.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nAdd the default recipe to your run_list.  Add appropriately formatted .reg files to the templates directory, and then update the payload array to deploy them.\n"
